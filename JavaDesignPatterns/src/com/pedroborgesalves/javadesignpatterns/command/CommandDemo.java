/**
 * <h1>Command Pattern</h1>
 * <p>
 * The intent of the Command Design Pattern is to encapsulate a request as an
 * object, thereby letting the developer to parameterise clients with different
 * requests, queue or log requests, and support undoable operations.</p>
 * <p>
 * - Parameterise objects by an action to perform.</p>
 * <p>
 * - Specify, queue, and execute requests at different times. A Command object
 * can have a lifetime independent of the original request. If the receiver of a
 * request can be represented in an address space-independent way, then you can
 * transfer a command object for the request to a different process and fulfill
 * the request there.</p>
 * <p>
 * - Support undo. The Commandâ€™s Execute operation can store state for reversing
 * its effects in the command itself. The Command interface must have an added
 * Un-execute operation that reverses the effects of a previous call to Execute.
 * Executed commands are stored in a history list. Unlimited-level undo and redo
 * is achieved by traversing this list backwards and forwards calling Un-execute
 * and Execute, respectively.</p>
 * <p>
 * - Support logging changes so that they can be reapplied in case of a system
 * crash. By augmenting the Command interface with load and store operations,
 * you can keep a persistent log of changes. Recovering from a crash involves
 * reloading logged commands from disk and re-executing them with the Execute
 * operation.</p>
 * <p>
 * Structure a system around high-level operations built on primitives
 * operations. Such a structure is common in information systems that support
 * transactions. A transaction encapsulates a set of changes to data. The
 * Command pattern offers a way to model transactions. Commands have a common
 * interface, letting you invoke all transactions the same way. The pattern also
 * makes it easy to extend the system with new transactions.</p>
