/**
 * <h1>Facade</h1>
 * <p>
 * - You want to provide a simple interface to a complex subsystem. Subsystems
 * often get more complex as they evolve. Most patterns, when applied, result in
 * more and smaller classes. This makes the subsystem more reusable and easier
 * to customise, but it also becomes harder to use for clients that donâ€™t need
 * to customise it. A facade can provide a simple default view of the subsystem
 * that is good enough for most clients. Only clients needing more
 * customizability will need to look beyond the facade.</p>
 * <p>
 * - There are many dependencies between clients and the implementation classes
 * of an abstraction. Introduce a facade to decouple the subsystem from clients
 * and other subsystems, thereby promoting subsystem independence and
 * portability.</p>
 * <p>
 * - You can layer your subsystems. Use a facade to define an entry point to
 * each subsystem level. If subsystems are dependent, then you can simplify the
 * dependencies between them by making them communicate with each other solely
 * through their facades.</p>
